# vision-ai / 01-cv-foundations

Stage 1 of an applied research series on vision-enabled AI agents.

This repository explores the foundational building blocks of computer vision, from image preprocessing and data augmentation to inference with modern pretrained models (CNNs, Vision Transformers, YOLO, etc.).

The aim is to establish a solid technical base for future stages, where these capabilities will be integrated into autonomous, vision-aware AI agents capable of perception, reasoning, and multimodal interaction.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand core computer vision workflows (preprocessing, inference, evaluation).
2. Work hands-on with PyTorch or TensorFlow and OpenCV.
3. Experiment with pretrained architectures (ResNet, ViT, YOLOv8).
4. Build a modular inference pipeline that can later be extended by agentic reasoning systems.
